# BetterMineOS

## Structure
/Servers is the folder where you make your server folders  
/Backups is for backups.. I shouldn't have to explain this

## Add these to your .bashrc
export BetterMineOS="$HOME/.../BetterMineOS/"  

## Usage
Run Commands/menu.sh to create a server. You can also use it to start, connect to, and stop servers.

Commands/server-backup.sh is cron friendly.

Commands/server-archive.sh takes a full .tar.gz of the server given.

## Notes
.gitignore ignores all the folders related to servers
